                <h5>Why build this app?</h5>

                <h6>
                    I built this app because my wife and her friends are artists and they always strive to get the best quality production for projects or auditions.
                    Since meeting my wife, I have learned many ways set up for self-tapping (online auditioning). We have acquired equipment over the years albeit not expensive, but the value for the money.
                    Therefore I sought to create a place where we can keep track of the equipment/gear we have as well as the important information in case of emergencies.

                    Well, I didn't just built the app for my wife's equipment, but also to keep track of any gadgets that I would acquire like videogame cosoles or headphones.
                    Even thought I like collecting videogames or trading card games, this app will be useful for any kind products like appliances, phone accesories and more. 
                    I hope that this app will be useful for other people too.
